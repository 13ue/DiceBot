Todo:
extra strategies - Fibbonachi and d’Alembert, preset list
implement other sites (requires prc api)
finish sqlite implementation
tip button
get server seed on randomize (JD)
Look for server seed of old bets
seperate stats and bet method from dobet() to easily switch between strategies
Use radio buttons for different strategy modes (martingale, labouchere, fibbonachi etc)
programmer mode (access to variables, write code for own strategies)


fibonacci:
  set base bet
  set stop point.
  set reset point

d’Alembert:
  base
  increment by x on wins
  decrement by y on loss
  stretch losses by a
  stretch wins by b



preset list:
  on loss, increment x (+/-)
  on win, reset, increment x(+/-)
  reaches end of list, reset, stop, decrement x


Not essential:
clean up code
multilingual support
finish tooltips
losing streak table redo
advanced zig zag
Proxy Authentication.
