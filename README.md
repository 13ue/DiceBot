Gambling is gambling no matter what you do or how good your strategy is. The house always wins if you keep playing. Winners know when to stop.
Like any human, I make mistakes, and like any program, the bot is bound to have a few bugs. Use the bot at your own risk. Should you come accross a bug, please report it with as much detail as possible to contact@seuntjie.com
